# Temperature-Prediction-Meteo

The main goal of this project is:
    •	To display my position (during this last 2 years) on a map (with pydeck) 
    •	Use an API to access an open weather and climate data (with Meteostat a Python library)
    •	use a machine learning algorithm (LSTM) to predict the weather
